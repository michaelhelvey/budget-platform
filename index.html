            Hi, this is the landing page for SimpleBudget.  It's a simple
            budgeting application designed for me and my family.  I plan to add
            features over time to make it a more generalized open source
            budgeting application, but one step at a time, as I have time and interest.

        <h2>Project goals:</h2>
        <p>
            Develop a simple budgeting web application that is based on the
            following principle: declare your fixed expenses and income up
            front, and track your variable transactions per-month.  The app will
            give you a very simple interface to add transactions in various
            categories (configurable), and tell you 1) how much you have left
            for the month in un-allocated (un-fixed) expenses, and 2) how you
            are doing in comparison to the previous month at the same time (as a
            percentage).
