# Controllers

Controllers are where the application logic lives. They are a glue layer between views (routes) and persistence (models). They may utilize functions in lib, but are themselves agnostic to 1) how the view works and 2) how the objects are persisted.

Controllers should not make any assumptions about either 1) view APIs (such as
DOM apis, or remix specific concepts) or 2) model persistence (beyond importing
autogenerated types from Prisma).
